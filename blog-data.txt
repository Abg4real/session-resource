What is internet?
The Internet (or internet) is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet
protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of
private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of
electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information
resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW),
electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.
How internet works?
When you opened your email, your email application sent a request to your email provider (for example, Gmail)
through your laptop’s Network Interface Card to your Wireless Access Point (WAP) using your local WiFi. The WAP
then sent the request through a wire to the local router.
The local router took that request and sent it to another router, which then sent to another router, and another
router, all the way through a chain of routers until the data was transferred over one of the transatlantic
communication cables to the United States.
There, it ended up at a Google data center (because you use Gmail). Google then processed your request to get any
new emails that had come in since you last loaded your email. They packaged up your new, unread emails in a
digital package called a “response,” and sent that package back to the same address (your laptop) that requested
the updates. The response probably took different routes on the way back, but it went through the same mechanisms.
The data was transferred from the Google data center through multiple lines and reached your home router/modem,
which made the data available over your home WiFi. Your laptop’s Network Interface Card received the response,
sent it to your email application, and then voilà—your new emails fill up your inbox! And that all happened in the
blink of an eye. It’s pretty amazing how the internet works, isn’t it? So the next
time someone asks, “what is the internet” or “how does the internet work?” hopefully you can use this simple
explanation to help them understand how this technology that’s so important to our modern daily life actually
works.
